    /// You might be wondering why the for loops below use `stride(from:to:step:)`
    /// instead of a simple `Range` such as `0 ..< height`?
    /// The answer is because in Swift 5.1, the iteration of ranges performs badly when the
    /// compiler optimisation level (`SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL`) is set to `-Onone`,
    /// which is eactly what happens when running this sample project in Debug mode.
    /// If this was a production app then it might not be worth worrying about but it is still
    /// worth being aware of.
